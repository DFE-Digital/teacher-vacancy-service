          A number of issues related to the accessibility of Teaching Vacancies were raised in an accessibility audit
          conducted in May 2019. Most of these have been corrected but there are still a number of issues the Teaching
          Vacancies team is working to resolve. When these issues have been resolved we will update this statement and
          the compliance status of Teaching Vacancies.

              <strong class='strong'>Issue</strong>: The colour used to indicate when an element such as a radio
              button has received focus does not meet the expected ratio.  This is a GDS Design System issue, however,
              so is not within our scope to correct. Note that a subtle movement effect also helps convey the focus
              state of a button, for example, so colour contrast is not the only tactic we use for improving
              distinguishability.<br /><strong class='strong'>Criterion failed</strong>:  1.4.11 Distinguishable:
