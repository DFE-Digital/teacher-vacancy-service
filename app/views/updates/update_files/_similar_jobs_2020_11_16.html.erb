At the bottom of each job listing we have added a Similar Jobs section. 
If there are any jobs that match the search criteria of the listing the job seeker is currently viewing, the job title and the name and address of the school will be displayed. 
Job seekers can then follow the links to view any of the listings they are interested in.
