      <p>Over the period since our last Ofsted inspection in November 2015 we have made significant progress. A new Headteacher and thirteen new teachers (including seven NQTs) took up post on 1st September 2017, and four new senior leaders took up post on 1st January 2018.

      <p>Framwellgate School Durham is a medium size 11-18 co-educational, non-selective secondary school within a Multi Academy Trust. There are 1,015 students on roll.
