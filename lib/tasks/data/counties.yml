# When the ONS API returns multiple rings for a county, some of these are small islands, one is the mainland of
# the county, and some are cities that are excluded because they are locally governed.

# There is no pattern as to which of the rings is relevant to us, so we have to individually specify which ring is the one
# we want (generally the largest), using 0-indexing.

# Structure in this file:
# - [County Name]: [the index of the ring we want]

# The way we import polygons is not sophisticated enough to include all schools for each county. The
# schools which we are failing to capture are:
# - In Essex, which has 10 rings, the 5th (I am not 0-indexing here) is Mersea Island, containing Mersea Island School.
# - In Hampshire, which has 2 rings, the 1st is Hayling Island, containing at least one school.
# - In Kent, which has 4 rings, the 3rd is Sheppey Island, containing at least one school.

# The Isles of Scilly only has one school at the time of writing, so we use the ring for St Mary's Island:

# This is an interim solution to updating the API, until we decide how best to deal with the omitted island schools.
# TODO: Deal with the omitted island schools. This will be easier when we are doing requests with multiple polygons
# e.g. for composite locations.
